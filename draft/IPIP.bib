abstract = {This article examines the adequacy of the "rules of thumb" conventional cutoff crite- ria and several new alternatives for various fit indexes used to evaluate model fit in practice. Using a 2-index presentation strategy, which includes using the maximum likelihood (ML)-based standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and supple- menting it with either Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Bollen's (1989) Fit Index (BL89), Relative Noncentrality Index (RNI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Gamma Hat, Mc- Donald's Centrality Index (Mc), or root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), various combinations of cutoff values from selected ranges of cutoff crite- ria for the ML-based SRMR and a given supplemental fit index were used to calculate rejection rates for various types of true-population and misspecified models; that is, models with misspecified factor covariance(s) and models with misspecified factor loading(s). The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2-index presentation strategy is re- quired to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true-population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML-based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true-population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.},

abstract = {Personality traits are organized hierarchically, with narrow, specific traits combining to define broad, global factors. The Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R; Costa {\&} McCrae, 1992c) assesses personality at both levels, with six specific facet scales in each of five broad domains. This article describes conceptual issues in specifying facets of a domain and reports evidence on the validity of NEO-PI-R facet scales. Facet analysis-the interpretation of a scale in terms of the specific facets with which it correlates-is illustrated using alternative measures of the five-factor model and occupational scales. Finally, the hierarchical interpretation of personality profiles is discussed. Interpretation on the domain level yields a rapid understanding of the individual interpretation of specific facet scales gives a more detailed assessment.},

abstract = {Personality facets, especially Big Five facets, have been shown to predict learning in school and university. This paper investigates their potential predictive power for training performance in a work environment. Based on trait activation theory by Tett and Burnett (2003) it was expected that depending on specific job demands, specific personality facets would be predictive. However, it was also tested whether invariant influences exist. Additionally, the impact of age, gender, and general mental ability was controlled for. The sample consisted of N= 501 apprentices. Training performance was operationalized by supervisor ratings in several learning domains. Findings confirm the hypotheses and revealed invariant positive contributions from dutifulness and Openness to ideas and invariant negative contributions from deliberation and Openness to fantasy. All other facets only functioned within a specific occupational group. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

From Duplicate 10 (Predicting Academic Success with the Big 5 Rated from Different Points of View: Self-Rated, Other Rated and Faked - Ziegler, M; Danay, E; Sch{\"{o}}lmerich, F; B{\"{u}}hner, M)

Based on the findings summarized above, the following specific hypotheses were made:
(1) Self- and other-ratings predict academic performance.
(2) The prediction is incremental after controlling for verbal, numerical and figural
reasoning.
(3) Other-ratings show incremental validity above and beyond self-ratings.
(4) Faking does not influence the criterion validity of personality domain-scores.

From Duplicate 11 (Big Five facets as predictor of job training performance: The role of specific job demands - Ziegler, Matthias; Bensch, Doreen; Maa{\ss}, Ulrike; Schult, Vivian; Vogel, Markus; B{\"{u}}hner, Markus)

Only for the Conscientiousness facets of dutifulness and deliberation and the Openness facets of fantasy and ideas invariant contributions could be found. In other words, regardless of the specific job, there were job demands that activated these personality facets.

abstract = {Factor analyses of 75 facet scales from 2 major Big Five inventories, in the Eugene-Springfield community sample (N=481), produced a 2-factor solution for the 15 facets in each domain. These findings indicate the existence of 2 distinct (but correlated) aspects within each of the Big Five, representing an intermediate level of personality structure between facets and domains. The authors characterized these factors in detail at the item level by correlating factor scores with the International Personality Item Pool (L. R. Goldberg, 1999). These correlations allowed the construction of a 100-item measure of the 10 factors (the Big Five Aspect Scales [BFAS]), which was validated in a 2nd sample (N=480). Finally, the authors examined the correlations of the 10 factors with scores derived from 10 genetic factors that a previous study identified underlying the shared variance among the Revised NEO Personality Inventory facets (K. L. Jang et al., 2002). The correspondence was strong enough to suggest that the 10 aspects of the Big Five may have distinct biological substrates.},

Consequently, the effective assessment of social supports is a key issue in both research and clinical practice. The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS; Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, {\&} Farley, 1988) divides perceived social support into 3 distinct constructs—that derived from Family members, from Friends, and from Significant Others. This study is the first to assess the MSPSS using confirmatory factor analysis in both a college student (N = 549) and psychiatric outpatient (N = 156) sample. Based on several goodness-of-fit indicators, a 3-factor model for the MSPSS was supported in both samples, as was a single, higher order domain of Global so- cial support. The perceived social support factors of Family and Friends consistently had the strongest associations with symptomatology. These results support the use of the MSPSS as a brief instrument for assessing the hierarchical structure of perceived social support in a variety of samples.},

Christal and E. C. Tupes. It was in the 1950s and early 1960s that the Air Force supported an active research program in the areas of motivation, personality, and temperament measurement. Mays (1954) investigated the relationship of length of acquaintance and the reliability of pooled trait ratings. Tupe (1957) conducted a study demonstrating a substantial relationship between peer trait ratings and later officer performance evaluations of graduates of the Officer Candidate School. Tupes and Christal (1958) investigated the factorial structure of personality trait ratings in six samples which varied in terms of raters, lengths of acquaintanceship and rating situation. Tupes (1959) conducted a study demonstrating that the factor structure of peer ratings of personality traits of senior officers closely resembles that of the junior officers. By this time it was clear that the five-factor model was a stable representation of the personality domain. It was only after complaints from students that they did not like peer ratings that the Air Force research program turned to other missions. Recently, however, a new interest has been taken in the personality measurement area.},

Effect sizes representing the relationships between these two constructs were compiled from 15 independent samples. Results were analyzed both within each individual personality disorder category and across personality disorders, indicating how personality disorders are different and similar, respectively, with regard to underlying personality traits. In terms of how personality disorders differ, the results showed that each disorder displays a five-factor model profile that is meaningful and predictable given its unique diagnostic criteria. With regard to their similarities, the findings revealed that the most prominent and consistent personality dimensions underlying a large number of the personality disorders are positive associations with Neuroticism and negative associations with Agreeableness. Extraversion appears to be a more discriminating dimension, as indicated by prominent but directionally variable associations with the personality disorders. The implications of these meta-analytic findings for clinical application and the advancement of future research are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Meta-a inspecting correlations between B5 dimensions and PD.
Very interesting in the conclusions, two limitation are drwan:
1) The FFM is OK for conceptualizing some PD (Avoidant or Borderline), but not enough for others (TOC and Schizoid). May be that this is because inconstencies between facets under the same dimension. i.e. spcecificity of facets may be useful
2)Some PD may be better caracterized by dimensions not inclluded in FFM NEO factes: foe example aberrant cognitions is not captured by the NEO-Pi and may be required to capture schizotypal psychopathology},

abstract = {Background. DSM-IV-TR suggests that clinicians should assess clinically relevant personality traits that do not necessarily constitute a formal personality disorder (PD), and should note these traits on Axis II, but DSM-IV-TR does not provide a trait model to guide the clinician. Our goal was to provide a provisional trait model and a preliminary corresponding assessment instrument, in our roles as members of the DSM-5 Personality and Personality Disorders Workgroup and workgroup advisors. Method. An initial list of specific traits and domains (broader groups of traits) was derived from DSM-5 literature reviews and workgroup deliberations, with a focus on capturing maladaptive personality characteristics deemed clinically salient, including those related to the criteria for DSM-IV-TR PDs. The model and instrument were then developed iteratively using data from community samples of treatment-seeking participants. The analytic approach relied on tools of modern psychometrics (e.g. item response theory models). Results. A total of 25 reliably measured core elements of personality description emerged that, together, delineate five broad domains of maladaptive personality variation: negative affect, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, and psychoticism. Conclusions. We developed a maladaptive personality trait model and corresponding instrument as a step on the path toward helping users of DSM-5 assess traits that may or may not constitute a formal PD. The inventory we developed is reprinted in its entirety in the Supplementary online material, with the goal of encouraging additional refinement and development by other investigators prior to the finalization of DSM-5. Continuing discussion should focus on various options for integrating personality traits into DSM-5},

abstract = {Conscientiousness is often found to predict academic outcomes, but is defined differently by different models of personality. High school students (N = 291) completed a large number of Conscientiousness items from different models and the Big Five Inventory (BFI). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of the items uncovered eight facets: Industriousness, Perfectionism, Tidiness, Procrastination Refrainment, Control, Cautiousness, Task Planning, and Perseverance. Correlations between these facets and the BFI revealed that all facets related strongly to Conscientiousness. Criterion-related validity was demonstrated by relationships between facets and academic outcomes such as grade-point-average, disciplinary infractions, and attainment of academic honors. Compared to BFI Conscientiousness, Industriousness and Perfectionism showed significantly stronger prediction of absenteeism and cognitive test scores, respectively. Results are discussed in terms of the usefulness of facet scores, the interpretation of personality scores for selection, and the development of intervention programs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {NEO instruments are widely used to assess Big Five personality factors, but confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) conducted at the item level do not support their a priori structure due, in part, to the overly restrictive CFA assumptions. We demonstrate that exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), an integration of CFA and exploratory factor analysis (EFA), overcomes these problems with responses (N = 3,390) to the 60-item NEO-Five-Factor Inventory: (a) ESEM fits the data better and results in substantially more differentiated (less correlated) factors than does CFA; (b) tests of gender invariance with the 13-model ESEM taxonomy of full measurement invariance of factor loadings, factor variances-covariances, item uniquenesses, correlated uniquenesses, item intercepts, differential item functioning, and latent means show that women score higher on all NEO Big Five factors; (c) longitudinal analyses support measurement invariance over time and the maturity principle (decreases in Neuroticism and increases in Agreeableness, Openness, and Conscientiousness). Using ESEM, we addressed substantively important questions with broad applicability to personality research that could not be appropriately addressed with the traditional approaches of either EFA or CFA.},

How valid are the BFI trait profiles of individual nations? And how are personality traits distributed throughout the world? The five-dimensional structure was robust across major regions of the world. Trait levels were related in predictable ways to self-esteem, sociosexuality, and national personality profiles. People from the geographic regions of South America and East Asia were significantly different in openness from those inhabiting other world regions.

Personality is conceived as (a) an individual's unique variation on the general evolutionary design for human nature, expressed as a developing pattern of (b) dispositional traits, (c) characteristic adaptations, and (d) self-defining life narratives, complexly and differentially situated (e) in culture and social context.

Composite estimates of facet scale stability, heritability, and cross-observer validity were broadly generalizable. Two estimates of retest reliability were independent predictors of the three validity criteria; none of three estimates of internal consistency was. Available evidence suggests the same pattern of results for other personality inventories. Internal consistency of scales can be useful as a check on data quality, but appears to be of limited utility for evaluating the potential validity of developed scales, and it should not be used as a substitute for retest reliability.

The results of this study may be expressed in percentages of the total number of terms that each pair of judges assigned to identically the same columns. Taking only the instances where all three judges agree, we find 141 words or 47 per cent of the list, whereas 6.25 per cent represents the chance expectation. Examining this average agreement more closely we next determine the peculiarities of each individual judge when his placements are compared with those of the other two judges. This analysis calls attention to perhaps the principal source of unreliability, namely the tendency of each judge to have a mental set of "leniency" favoring the inclusion of marginal or doubtful terms in one column rather than another. Four outside judges selected 130 of the 300 terms as strange and unfamiliar to them. The agreement of the three editors for this group of terms averaged only 45 per cent, as against 47 per cent for the total list, and 48 per cent for the remaining 170 more familiar terms. Apparently established usage and familiarity enhances but slightly the reliability of the placement.},

abstract = {William McDougall (1932), writing in the first issue of Character and Personality (which later became the Journal of Personality), discussed at length the special meanings of "character" and "personality" for the two languages in which the new journal was to be published. Toward the end of his essay, he offered an interesting conjecture: "Personality may to advantage be broadly analyzed into five distinguishable but separable factors, namely, intellect, character, temperament, disposition, and temper. ... each of these is highly complex [and] comprises many variables" (p. 15). Although "factor," as McDougall used the term, is closer to "topic" than to contemporary usage of the term, the suggestion was an uncanny anticipation of the results of half a century of work to organize the language of personality into a coherent structure.},

abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a frequently used multivariate analysis technique in statistics. Jennrich and Sampson (1966) solved a significant EFA factor loading matrix rotation problem by deriving the direct Quartimin rotation. Jennrich was also the first to develop standard errors for rotated solutions, although these have still not made their way into most statistical software programs. This is perhaps because Jennrich's achievements were partly overshadowed by the subsequent development of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) by J{\"{o}}reskog (1969). The strict requirement of zero cross-loadings in CFA, however, often does not fit the data well and has led to a tendency to rely on extensive model modification to find a well-fitting model. In such cases, searching for a well-fitting measurement model may be better carried out by EFA (Browne, 2001). Furthermore, misspecification of zero loadings usually leads to distorted factors with over-estimated factor correlations and subsequent distorted structural relations. This article describes an EFA-SEM (ESEM) approach, where in addition to or instead of a CFA measurement model, an EFA measurement model with rotations can be used in a structural equation model. The ESEM approach has recently been implemented in the Mplus program. ESEM gives access to all the usual SEM parameters and the loading rotation gives a transformation of structural coefficients as well. Standard errors and overall tests of model fit are obtained. Geomin and Target rotations are discussed. Examples of ESEM models include multiple-group EFA with measurement and structural invariance testing, test–retest (longitudinal) EFA, EFA with covariates and direct effects, and EFA with correlated residuals. Testing strategies with sequences of EFA and CFA models are discussed. Simulated and real data are used to illustrate the points.},

Most analyzed studies came from the tertiary level of education, but there were similar aggregate samples from secondary and tertiary education. There was a comparatively smaller sample derived from studies at the primary level. Academic performance was found to correlate significantly with Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness. Where tested, correlations between Conscientiousness and academic performance were largely independent of intelligence. When secondary academic performance was controlled for, Conscientiousness added as much to the prediction of tertiary academic performance as did intelligence. Strong evidence was found for moderators of correlations. Academic level (primary, secondary, or tertiary), average age of participant, and the interaction between academic level and age significantly moderated correlations with academic performance. Possible explanations for these moderator effects are discussed, and recommendations for future research are provided.},

Personality research indicates that life-satisfaction judgments are quite stable over extended periods of time and predicted by personality traits. The present article integrates these two research traditions. We propose that people rely on the same sources to form repeated life-satisfaction judgments over time. Some of these sources (e.g., memories of emotional experiences, academic performance) provide stable information that explains the stability in life-satisfaction judgments. Second, we propose that the influence of personality traits on life satisfaction is mediated by the use of chronically accessible sources because traits produce stability of these sources. Most important, the influence of extraversion and neuroticism is mediated by use of memories of past emotional experiences. To test this model, participants repeatedly judged life-satisfaction over the course of a semester. After each assessment, participants reported sources that they used for these judgments. Changes in reported sources were related to changes in life-satisfaction judgments. A path model demonstrated that chronically accessible and stable sources are related to stable individual differences in life-satisfaction. Furthermore, the model supported the hypothesis that personality effects were mediated by chronically accessible and stable sources. In sum, the results are consistent with our theory that life-satisfaction judgments are based on chronically accessible sources. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Academic performance was assessed throughout a three years period and via multiple criteria (e.g., exams and final-year project). In addition several indicators of academic behaviour, e.g., absenteeism, essay writing, tutors' exam predictions, were also examined with regard to both academic performance and personality traits. In sample 1 (N = 70), the Big Five personality factors (Costa {\&} McCrae, 1992) - particularly Neuroticism and Conscientiousness - were found to predict overall final exam marks over and above several academic predictors, accounting for more than 10{\%} of unique variance in overall exam marks. Results suggest that Neuroticism may impair academic performance, while Conscientiousness may lead to higher academic achievement. In sample 2 (N = 75) the EPQ-R (Eysenck {\&} Eysenck, 1985 was used as the personality measure and results showed the three superfactors were the most powerful predictor of academic performance, accounting for nearly 17{\%} of unique variance in overall exam results.

However, a notable limitation of existing measures of the FFM has been a lack of coverage of its maladaptive variants. A series of self-report inventories has been developed to assess for the maladaptive personality traits that define Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth edition; DSM–5) Section II personality disorders (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013) from the perspective of the FFM. In this paper, we provide an introduction to this Special Section, presenting the rationale and empirical support for these measures and placing them in the historical context of the recent revision to the APA diagnostic manual. This introduction is followed by 5 papers that provide further empirical support for these measures and address current issues within the personality assessment literature},

abstract = {Used J. L. Holland's (1985) RIASEC Model of vocational personalities and the Five Factor Model of personality to assess individual differences among study majors and to predict educational achievement. 934 last-year students (mean age 23.4 yrs) who enrolled in different academic majors filled out Dutch/Flemish adaptations of the NEO Personality Inventory and the Self-Directed Search. Results indicate that both models were useful to describe differences among different majors. Conscientiousness proved to be a general predictor of grades and study career. For the other Big Five dimensions, except for Agreeableness, major and/or gender specific relationships with educational outcomes were observed. Holland's interest dimensions were not related to educational achievement, except for some moderate gender or major specific correlations with the Investigative and the Artistic scales.

abstract = {We reviewed the recent empirical literature on the relations between the Big Five personality dimensions and post-secondary academic achievement, and found some consistent results. A meta-analysis showed Conscientiousness, in particular, to be most strongly and consistently associated with academic success. In addition, Openness to Experience was sometimes positively associated with scholastic achievement, whereas Extraversion was sometimes negatively related to the same criterion, although the empirical evidence regarding these latter two dimensions was somewhat mixed. Importantly, the literature indicates that the narrow personality traits or facets presumed to underlie the broad Big Five personality factors are generally stronger predictors of academic performance than are the Big Five personality factors themselves. Furthermore, personality predictors can account for variance in academic performance beyond that accounted for by measures of cognitive ability. A template for future research on this topic is proposed, which aims to improve the prediction of scholastic achievement by overcoming identifiable and easily correctable limitations of past studies. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

When this assumption is violated, inaccurate inferences associated with statistical and practical significance can occur. This manuscript emphasizes the importance of testing for measurement invariance (MI) and provides guidance when conducting these tests. Topics discussed are potential causes of noninvariant items, the difference between measurement bias and invariance, remedies for noninvariant measures, and considerations associated with model estimation. Using a sample of 491 teachers, a demonstration is also provided that evaluates whether a newly constructed behavior and instructional management scale is invariant across elementary and middle school teachers. Analyses revealed that the results differ slightly based on the estimation method utilized although these differences did not greatly influence the latent factor mean difference conclusions. Additional implications and considerations related to invariance testing are discussed.},

Both accounted for substantial proportions of variance in psychopathy scores, although the NEO PI-R accounted for larger proportions and manifested greater incremental validity when using the broader domains of each measure; the differences decreased when the narrower facets/subscales were used. The results suggest that, although both measures assess psychopathy-related traits, the NEO PI-R provides a more complete description because of its assessment of interpersonal antagonism and the central role of this construct in psychopathy.},

This division led to the revelation of substantial overlap among disorders both within and across axes and to the joint study of normal and abnormal personality. The author reviews these literatures and proposes an integrative framework to explain personality-psychopathology relations: Three broad, innate temperament dimensions--negative affectivity, positive affectivity, and disinhibition--differentiate through both biologically and environmentally based developmental processes into a hierarchical personality trait structure and, at their extremes, are risk factors (diatheses) for psychopathology, especially given adverse life experiences (stress).},

abstract = {Personality-outcome associations, typically represented using the Big Five personality domains, are often weak and lack discriminant validity. We hypothesized that representing the associations using personality questionnaire items (nuances) could increase both prediction strength and discriminativeness. Using the National Child Development Study (N = 8,719), we predicted 40 diverse outcomes from both the Big Five domains and their 50 items. Models were trained (using penalized regression) and applied for prediction in independent sample partitions (with 100 permutations). Item-models tended to out-predict Big Five-models (explaining on average 27{\%} more variance), regardless of outcomes' independently-rated breadth/behavioral specificity. Item-based predictions were also more discriminative among outcomes, whereas domain-based predictions were more attuned to outcomes' independently-rated desirability. We also show how outcomes can be mapped in terms of their associations with personality (personality correlations) and, thereby, how personality characteristics can account for the co-variance among outcomes (personality proportions). These findings are consistent with the possibilities that a) the associations of personality with outcomes often pertain to large numbers of specific behavioral, cognitive, affective and motivational characteristics represented by single questionnaire items rather than to the broader (underlying) traits that these items are ostensibly indicators of and b) personality characteristics can contribute to associations between outcomes.},

abstract = {Subjective well-being (SWB), people's emotional and cognitive evaluations of their lives, includes what lay people call happiness, peace, fulfillment, and life satisfaction. Personality dispositions such as extraversion, neuroticism, and self-esteem can markedly influence levels of SWB. Although personality can explain a significant amount of the variability in SWB, life circumstances also influence long-term levels. Cultural variables explain differences in mean levels of SWB and appear to be due to objective factors such as wealth, to norms dictating appropriate feelings and how important SWB is considered to be, and to the relative approach versus avoidance tendencies of societies. Culture can also moderate which variables most influence SWB. Although it is challenging to assess SWB across societies, the measures have some degree of cross-cultural validity. Although nations can be evaluated by their levels of SWB, there are still many open questions in this area.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study investigates: (1) which personality traits are typical of medical students as compared to other students, and (2) which personality traits predict medical student performance in pre-clinical years. DESIGN: This paper reports a cross-sectional inventory study of students in nine academic majors and a prospective longitudinal study of one cohort of medical students assessed by inventory during their first preclinical year and by university examination at the end of each pre-clinical year. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In 1997, a combined total of 785 students entered medical studies courses in five Flemish universities. Of these, 631 (80.4{\%}) completed the NEO-PI-R (i.e. a measure of the Five-Factor Model of Personality). This was also completed by 914 Year 1 students of seven other academic majors at Ghent University. Year end scores for medical students were obtained for 607 students in Year 1, for 413 in Year 2, and for 341 in Year 3. RESULTS: Medical studies falls into the group of majors where students score highest on extraversion and agreeableness. Conscientiousness (i.e. self-achievement and self-discipline) significantly predicts final scores in each pre-clinical year. Medical students who score low on conscientiousness and high on gregariousness and excitement-seeking are significantly less likely to sit examinations successfully. CONCLUSIONS: The higher scores for extraversion and agreeableness, two dimensions defining the interpersonal dynamic, may be beneficial for doctors' collaboration and communication skills in future professional practice. Because conscientiousness affects examination results and can be reliably assessed at the start of a medical study career, personality assessment may be a useful tool in student counselling and guidance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND High numbers of employees are coping with affective disorders. At the same time, ambitiousness, achievement striving and a strong sense of personal control and responsibility are personality characteristics that are nowadays regarded as key to good work functioning, whereas social work circumstances tend to be neglected. However, it is largely unkown how personality characteristics and work circumstances affect work functioning when facing an affective disorder. Given the high burden of affective disorders on occupational health, we investigate these issues in the context of affective disorders and absenteeism from work. The principal aim of this paper is to examine whether particular personality characteristics that reflect self-governance (conscientiousness and mastery) and work circumstances (demands, control, support) influence the impact of affective disorders on long-term absenteeism ({\textgreater}10 working days). METHODS Baseline and 1-year follow-up data from 1249 participants in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) in 2004-2006 was employed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed, including interaction effects between depressive, anxiety, and comorbid disorders and personality and work circumstances. RESULTS In general, mastery and conscientiousness increased nor diminished odds of subsequent long-term absenteeism, whereas higher job support significantly decreased these odds. Interaction effects showed that the impact of affective disorders on absenteeism was stronger for highly conscientious employees and for employees who experienced high job demands. CONCLUSIONS Affective disorders may particularly severely affect work functioning of employees who are highly conscientious or face high psychological job demands. Adjusting working conditions to their individual needs may prevent excessive work absence.},

This article uses a specific type of environmental behavior, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to clarify which personality correlates are most robustly associated with behavior, and to test mediation of those effects through attitudes. A large (N = 345) sample of United States adults representative in age, gender, and ethnicity completed the 100-item HEXACO personality inventory, a novel self-report measure of behaviors that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and scales of environmental and political attitudes. Accounting for demographics, emissions-reducing behaviors were most strongly predicted by Openness, Conscientiousness, and Extraversion, and these effects of personality were mediated by attitudes toward the natural environment.

abstract = {Until recently, research focus has been on a variety of demographic, attitudinal, and organizational variables in predicting and explaining absenteeism. If personality traits predict absenteeism, then it may be possible to use measures of these traits to identify and select job applicants and thereby reduce absenteeism rates. In this research, our goal was to examine whether integrity tests could be used to predict absenteeism. Meta-analysis was applied to studies of the validity of pre-employment integrity tests for predicting voluntary absenteeism. Twenty-eight studies based on a total sample of 13 972 were meta-analysed. The estimated mean predictive validity of personality-based integrity tests was 0.33. This operational validity generalized across various predictor scales, organizations, settings, and jobs (SDrho = 0.00). Overt integrity tests, however showed much lower predictive validity for absenteeism and greater variability than personality-based tests (rho = 0. 09; SDrho = 0. 16). The results indicate that a personnel selection approach to reducing absenteeism in organizations may be a useful strategy, particularly if personality-based integrity tests are utilized. Potential explanations for differences between these results and those found for Big Five measures of personality are offered. Future research investigating models of absenteeism should incorporate the personality constructs assessed by integrity tests. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

However, Extraversion and Neuroticism are multifaceted constructs that combine more specific traits. This article examined the contribution of facets of Extraversion and Neuroticism to life satisfaction in four studies. The depression facet of Neuroticism and the positive emotions/cheerfulness facet of Extraversion were the strongest and most consistent predictors of life satisfaction. These two facets often accounted for more variance in life satisfaction than Neuroticism and Extraversion. The findings suggest that measures of depression and positive emotions/cheerfulness are necessary and sufficient to predict life satisfaction from personality traits. The results also lead to a more refined understanding of the specific personality traits that influence life satisfaction: Depression is more important than anxiety or anger and a cheerful temperament is more important than being active or sociable.

abstract = {wo Monte Carlo studies were conducted to examine the sensitivity of goodness of fit indexes to lack of measurement invariance at 3 commonly tested levels: factor loadings, intercepts, and residual variances. Standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) appears to be more sensitive to lack of invariance in factor loadings than in intercepts or residual variances. Comparative fit index (CFI) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) appear to be equally sensitive to all 3 types of lack of invariance. The most intriguing finding is that changes in fit statistics are affected by the interaction between the pattern of invariance and the proportion of invariant items: when the pattern of lack of invariance is uniform, the relation is nonmonotonic, whereas when the pattern of lack of invariance is mixed, the relation is monotonic. Unequal sample sizes affect changes across all 3 levels of invariance: Changes are bigger when sample sizes are equal rather than when they are unequal. Cutoff points for testing invariance at different levels are recommended.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Personality is reliably associated with academic performance, but personality measurement in primary education can be problematic. Young children find it difficult to accurately self-rate personality, and dominant models of adult personality may be inappropriate for children.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAIMS: This meta-analysis was conducted to determine the validity of the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality for statistically predicting children's academic performance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSAMPLE: Literature search identified 12 reports, with cumulative sample sizes ranging from 4,382 (19 correlations) to 5,706 (23 correlations) for correlations with Emotional Stability and Conscientiousness respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: Hunter-Schmidt random-effects meta-analysis was used, and moderators were tested using sample-weighted regression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: When compared with self-rated measures, adult-rated Conscientiousness and Openness were more strongly correlated with academic performance, but adult-rated Agreeableness was less strongly correlated. Q-set-based assessments had lower validity, which appeared to explain moderating effects of rating source. Moderating effects were not found for age, year of education (grades 1-7), or language within which the study was conducted.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Conscientiousness and Openness had two of the strongest correlations with academic performance yet reported, comparable with previous meta-analytic correlations of academic performance with instructional quality, cognitive ability, and feedback. The FFM appears to be valid for educational research with children. Openness, which has no counterpart in models of children's temperament, should be further researched with children. Future research should examine the measurement of childhood personality, its relationship with intelligence, the extent to which it is malleable in primary education, and its causal relationship with academic performance.},

abstract = {Conscientiousness is a predictor of several health behaviors, but the contribution of its facets is not yet known. Partial correlation and multiple regression have been utilized in previous studies, but a third approach is possible. Latent variable modeling combines the advantages of both these methods. Data from 345 healthy adults living in the UK enrolled in a longitudinal study of Internet users were used to illustrate this. Conscientiousness was extracted as a latent variable defined by its six facets. Health behaviors were modeled as a latent variable, defined by the Wellness Behaviors, Accident Control and Traffic Risk sub-scales of the Health Behavior Marker Scales (HBMS, Vickers, Conway {\&} Hervig, 1990). Given that the Self-discipline facet has been previously shown to contribute uniquely to health criteria, a direct pathway was modeled from Self-discipline to the HBMS ({\ss} = .27). In addition to illustrating a 'third approach' to modeling facets, this study replicates and extends prior research by examining the associations between Conscientiousness and the HBMS in an Internet sample. The results strengthen claims by several commentators that measuring and modeling personality facets can help increase our understanding of how personality traits influence health behaviors. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Since its inception in 1996, the use of items and scales from the IPIP has increased dramatically. Items from the IPIP have been translated from English into more than 25 other languages. Currently over 80 publications using IPIP scales are listed at the IPIP Web site (http://ipip.ori.org), and the rate of IPIP-related publications has been increasing rapidly. The growing popularity of the IPIP can be attributed to five factors: (1) It is cost free; (2) its items can be obtained instantaneously via the Internet; (3) it includes over 2000 items, all easily available for inspection; (4) scoring keys for IPIP scales are provided; and (5) its items can be presented in any order, interspersed with other items, reworded, translated into other languages, and administered on the World Wide Web without asking permission of anyone. The unrestricted availability of the IPIP raises concerns about possible misuse by unqualified persons, and the freedom of researchers to use the IPIP in idiosyncratic ways raises the possibility of fragmentation rather than scientific unification in personality research. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.
