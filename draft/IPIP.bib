abstract = {Background. DSM-IV-TR suggests that clinicians should assess clinically relevant personality traits that do not necessarily constitute a formal personality disorder (PD), and should note these traits on Axis II, but DSM-IV-TR does not provide a trait model to guide the clinician. Our goal was to provide a provisional trait model and a preliminary corresponding assessment instrument, in our roles as members of the DSM-5 Personality and Personality Disorders Workgroup and workgroup advisors. Method. An initial list of specific traits and domains (broader groups of traits) was derived from DSM-5 literature reviews and workgroup deliberations, with a focus on capturing maladaptive personality characteristics deemed clinically salient, including those related to the criteria for DSM-IV-TR PDs. The model and instrument were then developed iteratively using data from community samples of treatment-seeking participants. The analytic approach relied on tools of modern psychometrics (e.g. item response theory models). Results. A total of 25 reliably measured core elements of personality description emerged that, together, delineate five broad domains of maladaptive personality variation: negative affect, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, and psychoticism. Conclusions. We developed a maladaptive personality trait model and corresponding instrument as a step on the path toward helping users of DSM-5 assess traits that may or may not constitute a formal PD. The inventory we developed is reprinted in its entirety in the Supplementary online material, with the goal of encouraging additional refinement and development by other investigators prior to the finalization of DSM-5. Continuing discussion should focus on various options for integrating personality traits into DSM-5},

abstract = {Personality-outcome associations, typically represented using the Big Five personality domains, are often weak and lack discriminant validity. We hypothesized that representing the associations using personality questionnaire items (nuances) could increase both prediction strength and discriminativeness. Using the National Child Development Study (N = 8,719), we predicted 40 diverse outcomes from both the Big Five domains and their 50 items. Models were trained (using penalized regression) and applied for prediction in independent sample partitions (with 100 permutations). Item-models tended to out-predict Big Five-models (explaining on average 27{\%} more variance), regardless of outcomes' independently-rated breadth/behavioral specificity. Item-based predictions were also more discriminative among outcomes, whereas domain-based predictions were more attuned to outcomes' independently-rated desirability. We also show how outcomes can be mapped in terms of their associations with personality (personality correlations) and, thereby, how personality characteristics can account for the co-variance among outcomes (personality proportions). These findings are consistent with the possibilities that a) the associations of personality with outcomes often pertain to large numbers of specific behavioral, cognitive, affective and motivational characteristics represented by single questionnaire items rather than to the broader (underlying) traits that these items are ostensibly indicators of and b) personality characteristics can contribute to associations between outcomes.},

abstract = {The current meta-analysis reviews research examining the relationships between each of the five-factor model personality dimensions and each of the 10 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) personality disorder diagnostic categories. Effect sizes representing the relationships between these two constructs were compiled from 15 independent samples. Results were analyzed both within each individual personality disorder category and across personality disorders, indicating how personality disorders are different and similar, respectively, with regard to underlying personality traits. In terms of how personality disorders differ, the results showed that each disorder displays a five-factor model profile that is meaningful and predictable given its unique diagnostic criteria. With regard to their similarities, the findings revealed that the most prominent and consistent personality dimensions underlying a large number of the personality disorders are positive associations with Neuroticism and negative associations with Agreeableness. Extraversion appears to be a more discriminating dimension, as indicated by prominent but directionally variable associations with the personality disorders. The implications of these meta-analytic findings for clinical application and the advancement of future research are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Personality facets, especially Big Five facets, have been shown to predict learning in school and university. This paper investigates their potential predictive power for training performance in a work environment. Based on trait activation theory by Tett and Burnett (2003) it was expected that depending on specific job demands, specific personality facets would be predictive. However, it was also tested whether invariant influences exist. Additionally, the impact of age, gender, and general mental ability was controlled for. The sample consisted of N= 501 apprentices. Training performance was operationalized by supervisor ratings in several learning domains. Findings confirm the hypotheses and revealed invariant positive contributions from dutifulness and Openness to ideas and invariant negative contributions from deliberation and Openness to fantasy. All other facets only functioned within a specific occupational group. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Based on the findings summarized above, the following specific hypotheses were made:
(1) Self- and other-ratings predict academic performance.
(2) The prediction is incremental after controlling for verbal, numerical and figural
reasoning.
(3) Other-ratings show incremental validity above and beyond self-ratings.
(4) Faking does not influence the criterion validity of personality domain-scores.

From Duplicate 11 (Big Five facets as predictor of job training performance: The role of specific job demands - Ziegler, Matthias; Bensch, Doreen; Maa{\ss}, Ulrike; Schult, Vivian; Vogel, Markus; B{\"{u}}hner, Markus)

Only for the Conscientiousness facets of dutifulness and deliberation and the Openness facets of fantasy and ideas invariant contributions could be found. In other words, regardless of the specific job, there were job demands that activated these personality facets.

abstract = {The ability of personality traits to predict important life outcomes has traditionally been questioned because of the putative small effects of personality. In this article, we compare the predictive validity of personality traits with that of socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive ability to test the relative contribution of personality traits to predictions of three critical outcomes: mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment. Only evidence from prospective longitudinal studies was considered. In addition, an attempt was made to limit the review to studies that controlled for important background factors. Results showed that the magnitude of the effects of personality traits on mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment was indistinguishable from the effects of SES and cognitive ability on these outcomes. These results demonstrate the influence of personality traits on important life outcomes, highlight the need to more routinely incorporate measures of personality into quality of life surveys, and encourage further research about the developmental origins of personality traits and the processes by which these traits influence diverse life outcomes.},

The results of this study may be expressed in percentages of the total number of terms that each pair of judges assigned to identically the same columns. Taking only the instances where all three judges agree, we find 141 words or 47 per cent of the list, whereas 6.25 per cent represents the chance expectation. Examining this average agreement more closely we next determine the peculiarities of each individual judge when his placements are compared with those of the other two judges. This analysis calls attention to perhaps the principal source of unreliability, namely the tendency of each judge to have a mental set of "leniency" favoring the inclusion of marginal or doubtful terms in one column rather than another. Four outside judges selected 130 of the 300 terms as strange and unfamiliar to them. The agreement of the three editors for this group of terms averaged only 45 per cent, as against 47 per cent for the total list, and 48 per cent for the remaining 170 more familiar terms.

High school students (N = 291) completed a large number of Conscientiousness items from different models and the Big Five Inventory (BFI). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of the items uncovered eight facets: Industriousness, Perfectionism, Tidiness, Procrastination Refrainment, Control, Cautiousness, Task Planning, and Perseverance. Correlations between these facets and the BFI revealed that all facets related strongly to Conscientiousness. Criterion-related validity was demonstrated by relationships between facets and academic outcomes such as grade-point-average, disciplinary infractions, and attainment of academic honors. Compared to BFI Conscientiousness, Industriousness and Perfectionism showed significantly stronger prediction of absenteeism and cognitive test scores, respectively. Results are discussed in terms of the usefulness of facet scores, the interpretation of personality scores for selection, and the development of intervention programs. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In the first of 3 studies, 1,431 trait adjectives grouped into 75 clusters were analyzed; virtually identical structures emerged in 10 replications, each based on a different factor-analytic procedure. A 2nd study of 479 common terms grouped into 133 synonym dusters revealed the same structure in 2 samples of self-ratings and in 2 samples of peer ratings. None of the factors beyond the 5th generalized across the samples. In the 3rd study, analyses of 100 clusters derived from 339 trait terms suggest their potential utility as Big-Five markers in future studies.},

The psychologists' versions of the factors were better integrated, but the significant finding is that they agree essentially with factors observed in self-ratings.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Personality is reliably associated with academic performance, but personality measurement in primary education can be problematic. Young children find it difficult to accurately self-rate personality, and dominant models of adult personality may be inappropriate for children.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAIMS: This meta-analysis was conducted to determine the validity of the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality for statistically predicting children's academic performance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSAMPLE: Literature search identified 12 reports, with cumulative sample sizes ranging from 4,382 (19 correlations) to 5,706 (23 correlations) for correlations with Emotional Stability and Conscientiousness respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: Hunter-Schmidt random-effects meta-analysis was used, and moderators were tested using sample-weighted regression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: When compared with self-rated measures, adult-rated Conscientiousness and Openness were more strongly correlated with academic performance, but adult-rated Agreeableness was less strongly correlated. Q-set-based assessments had lower validity, which appeared to explain moderating effects of rating source. Moderating effects were not found for age, year of education (grades 1-7), or language within which the study was conducted.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Conscientiousness and Openness had two of the strongest correlations with academic performance yet reported, comparable with previous meta-analytic correlations of academic performance with instructional quality, cognitive ability, and feedback. The FFM appears to be valid for educational research with children. Openness, which has no counterpart in models of children's temperament, should be further researched with children. Future research should examine the measurement of childhood personality, its relationship with intelligence, the extent to which it is malleable in primary education, and its causal relationship with academic performance.},

abstract = {Seven experts on personality measurement here discuss the viability of public-domain personality measures, focusing on the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) as a prototype. Since its inception in 1996, the use of items and scales from the IPIP has increased dramatically. Items from the IPIP have been translated from English into more than 25 other languages. Currently over 80 publications using IPIP scales are listed at the IPIP Web site (http://ipip.ori.org), and the rate of IPIP-related publications has been increasing rapidly. The growing popularity of the IPIP can be attributed to five factors: (1) It is cost free; (2) its items can be obtained instantaneously via the Internet; (3) it includes over 2000 items, all easily available for inspection; (4) scoring keys for IPIP scales are provided; and (5) its items can be presented in any order, interspersed with other items, reworded, translated into other languages, and administered on the World Wide Web without asking permission of anyone. The unrestricted availability of the IPIP raises concerns about possible misuse by unqualified persons, and the freedom of researchers to use the IPIP in idiosyncratic ways raises the possibility of fragmentation rather than scientific unification in personality research. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The generality of this 5-factor model is here demonstrated across unusually comprehen-sive sets of trait terms. In the first of 3 studies, 1,431 trait adjectives grouped into 75 clusters were analyzed; virtually identical structures emerged in 10 replications, each based on a different factor-analytic procedure. A 2nd study of 479 common terms grouped into 133 synonym dusters revealed the same structure in 2 samples of self-ratings and in 2 samples of peer ratings. None of the factors beyond the 5th generalized across the samples. In the 3rd study, analyses of 100 clusters derived from 339 trait terms suggest their potential utility as Big-Five markers in future studies.},

The correlations were determined between their scores on these two inventories. Personality disorders and personality factors were found to be related in ways similar to those found in other research and with nonclinical samples. A case history illustrates the types of information provided by the MCMI and NEO-PI in an initial evaluation and retesting 4 mo later. Consistencies between the two testings with the NEO-PI and differences in results from the testings with the MCMI raise issues for forensic evaluations and the conceptualization of personality disorders and personality factors.

There was a comparatively smaller sample derived from studies at the primary level. Academic performance was found to correlate significantly with Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness. Where tested, correlations between Conscientiousness and academic performance were largely independent of intelligence. When secondary academic performance was controlled for, Conscientiousness added as much to the prediction of tertiary academic performance as did intelligence. Strong evidence was found for moderators of correlations. Academic level (primary, secondary, or tertiary), average age of participant, and the interaction between academic level and age significantly moderated correlations with academic performance.

abstract = {This article traces previous studies in the area of personality trait supported by the U.S. Air Force, that led to the pioneering study Recurrent Personality Factors Based on Trait ratings by Raymond E. Christal and E. C. Tupes. It was in the 1950s and early 1960s that the Air Force supported an active research program in the areas of motivation, personality, and temperament measurement. Mays (1954) investigated the relationship of length of acquaintance and the reliability of pooled trait ratings. Tupe (1957) conducted a study demonstrating a substantial relationship between peer trait ratings and later officer performance evaluations of graduates of the Officer Candidate School. Tupes and Christal (1958) investigated the factorial structure of personality trait ratings in six samples which varied in terms of raters, lengths of acquaintanceship and rating situation. Tupes (1959) conducted a study demonstrating that the factor structure of peer ratings of personality traits of senior officers closely resembles that of the junior officers. By this time it was clear that the five-factor model was a stable representation of the personality domain. It was only after complaints from students that they did not like peer ratings that the Air Force research program turned to other missions. Recently, however, a new interest has been taken in the personality measurement area.},

abstract = {Personality and psychopathology long have been viewed as related domains, but the precise nature of their relations remains unclear. Through most of the 20th century, they were studied as separate fields; within psychopathology, clinical syndromes were separated from personality disorders in 1980. This division led to the revelation of substantial overlap among disorders both within and across axes and to the joint study of normal and abnormal personality. The author reviews these literatures and proposes an integrative framework to explain personality-psychopathology relations: Three broad, innate temperament dimensions--negative affectivity, positive affectivity, and disinhibition--differentiate through both biologically and environmentally based developmental processes into a hierarchical personality trait structure and, at their extremes, are risk factors (diatheses) for psychopathology, especially given adverse life experiences (stress).},

distinguish personality-disordered groups from community norms,
they largely fail to distinguish specific personality disorders from
each other. However, the lower order facets of the FFM domains
may provide more specific assessments of personality pathology,},

The Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R; Costa {\&} McCrae, 1992c) assesses personality at both levels, with six specific facet scales in each of five broad domains. This article describes conceptual issues in specifying facets of a domain and reports evidence on the validity of NEO-PI-R facet scales. Facet analysis-the interpretation of a scale in terms of the specific facets with which it correlates-is illustrated using alternative measures of the five-factor model and occupational scales. Finally, the hierarchical interpretation of personality profiles is discussed. Interpretation on the domain level yields a rapid understanding of the individual interpretation of specific facet scales gives a more detailed assessment.},

abstract = {Research has yielded mixed results in attempting to augment the broad Big Five personality traits with other, narrow traits in predicting real-world criteria like job performance in adults. We examined narrow traits in addition to the Big Five in predicting academic success among adolescents. We investigated individual grade point average (GPA) and scores from the Adolescent Personal Style Inventory among 220 seventh-graders and 290 tenth-graders, including agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, extraversion, and openness, plus four narrow traits, aggression, optimism, tough-mindedness, and work drive. All traits correlated significantly ( P {\textless}.01) with GPA among both 7th- and 10th-graders. The Big Five traits together accounted for 15{\%} and 10{\%} of variance in GPA among 7th and 10th graders, respectively. Consistent with prior research, narrow traits accounted for 8{\%} and 12{\%} of the variance in GPA among the 7th and 10th graders, respectively, beyond that predicted by the Big Five. The narrow traits aggression and work drive together accounted for 18{\%} and 21{\%} of the variance in GPA in 7th and 10th graders, respectively, to which the Big Five added 1{\%} in the 7th graders and no significant increment among 10th graders. Results provide clear evidence of a relationship between personality and academic success among adolescents, and carry practical as well theoretical implications. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The ability of personality traits to predict im- portant life outcomes has traditionally been questioned because of the putative small effects of personality. In this article, we compare the predictive validity of personality traits with that of socioeconomic status (SES) and cogni- tive ability to test the relative contribution of personality traits to predictions of three critical outcomes: mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment. Only evidence from prospective longitudinal studies was considered. In addi- tion, an attempt was made to limit the review to studies that controlled for important background factors. Results showed that the magnitude of the effects of personality traits on mortality, divorce, and occupational attainment was indistinguishable from the effects of SES and cognitive ability on these outcomes. These results demonstrate the influence of personality traits on important life outcomes, highlight the need to more routinely incorporate measures of personality into quality of life surveys, and encourage further research about the developmental origins of per- sonality traits and the processes by which these traits in- fluence diverse life outcomes.},
