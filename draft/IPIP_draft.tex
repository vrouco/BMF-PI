\section{1. Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Over the last decades, the Five Factor Model as well as the Big Five
model have become widely accepted models for describing general
attributes of personality. Often the terms are even used synonymously,
which is why we will refer to the Big Five from here on. The Big Five is
a hierarchical model which describes human individual differences in
personality at the dispositional level: one of the most basic,
universal, biologically-influenced and stable layers of human
inter-individual differences in behavior, cognition and feeling (McAdams
\& Pals, 2006). Its hierarchical conception is relevant to acknowledge
behavior from the most specific (nuances) to the most broad differences
in temperament and character (dimensions), through a varying number of
mid-level personality characteristics (facets). Most of the research
concerning criterion validity of the Big Five inventories has focused on
the covariation between the Big Five dimensions and relevant external
outcomes. However, specific dispositional characteristics captured on
the facet level might be of extreme utility to provide more complex
descriptions of individuality and to predict life outcomes to a major
extent (Lounsbury, Sundstrom, Loveland, \& Gibson, 2002; Paunonen \&
Ashton, 2001; Ziegler et al., 2014). Unfortunately, the number and
nature of the facets below the Big Five is far from being consensual. In
fact, different facet level models have been proposed (XXXX). One
potential reason for this could be that many facet level models were
developed after a questionnaire version without such a level had been
published. Thus, the facets were developed as an elaboration or
extension to an existing domain measure. While this has many theoretical
advantages it also has the disadvantage of potentially limiting the
search space of possible facets. In this work we aim at maximizing this
search space and present a personality questionnaire which is broad at
the facet level, open-access, and measurement invariant across two
different cultures.

\hypertarget{a-short-history-of-the-big-five}{%
\subsection{1.2. A short history of the Big
Five}\label{a-short-history-of-the-big-five}}

Francis Galton is credited as being the one who proposed the fundamental
lexical hypothesis as a ground from where to describe interpersonal
differences in personality. The hypothesis states that every apprehended
characteristic in the realm of personality should have its place in the
natural language, a corollary derived from this first statement is that
the essential features must represent a unique word in the lexical
universe of this language. Galton (1884) himself, and later Allport and
Odbert (1936) and still later Norman (1967), used English dictionaries
for a systematic collection of all adjectives which could be related to
human personality characteristics. Using exploratory factor analyses on
self and other ratings, five broad factors could repeatedly be extracted
from the data.

Cattell was one of the first researchers who systematically applied
exploratory factor analysis in order to explore personality structure.
He inspected the correlation structure of the items in the word lists of
his predecessors, finding 16 oblique personality factors, including one
factor specifically for intelligence, these factors form the 16-PF.
These 16 factors were the primary factors in a hierarchical structure
for Cattell (coetany to L.L. Thurstone and undoubtedly influenced by
him). Cattell himself viewed personality as a hierarchical structure,
containing three layers (Cattell, 1956). The second order factors
resemble the Big Five dimensions (Digman, 1990).

Different researchers followed Cattell in the study of dispositional
traits of personality. One of the most influential models was Eysenck`s
Big Three. Grounded on a strong biological basis, Eysenck`s theory
supposed a link between temperament and personality. Its structural
proposal concerned at first two big factors, named Neuroticism
vs.~Emotional stability and Extraversion vs.~Introversion. These two
dimensions were later joined by a third factor that Eysenck called
Psychoticism. This label was criticized by others who suggested that a
more appropriate term would be psychopathy (Digman, 1990). Eysenck`s big
two are still \enquote{alive}" today in the Big Five, and his third
factor, psychoticism, can be operationalized as other dimensions within
the Big Five: Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness.

A large number of studies have focused on the problem of personality
structure resulting in a five factor solution (Borgatta, 1964; Fiske,
1949; Norman, 1967; Tupes \& Christal, 1961). Possibly the two most
widely cited works relating to the foundations of the Big Five are those
by Goldberg et al. (2006) and Costa and McCrae (1995). Goldberg can be
seen as one of the first who extended research concerning the Big Five,
while McRae and Costa`s importance rests on popularizing the terminology
(OCEAN) and the development of one of the most used tools to assess
personality based on the Big Five: the NEO-PI. The Big Five dimensions
are labeled as follows: I) Extraversion vs.~Introversion. II)
Agreeableness or Friendliness. III) Conscientiousness or Achievement or
Will. IV) Emotional Stability vs.~Neuroticism, and V) Openness or
Intellect or Culture.

One of the most important features of the Big Five is the fact that it
could be replicated in different languages. Research is available in
Japanese, Vietnamese, German, Spanish, Greek, and many more
({\textbf{???}}; {\textbf{???}}). This finding suggests that the way
human beings construe personality is at some point universal and that
its basic features are retained within the Big Five. Another essential
characteristic relies on its hierarchical nature. The five domains are
useful to retain the big picture of personality, maximize the situation
consistency and reliably assess difficult subjects such as children.
Nonetheless, each dimension is conceptualized as a latent construct
formed by more specific narrow factors called facets, which in turn are
useful to depict the impact of personality characteristics into specific
behaviors and concrete life outcomes.

The Big Five has proven to be a valid theoretical and empirical model to
predict relevant life outcomes. Research such as Ozer and Benet-Martínez
(2006) or Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner, Caspi, and Goldberg (2007) has shown
that scores for the Big Five dimensions (and their related facets) are
able to explain outcomes such as academic and work performance, health,
personality disorders, political attitudes and many more. The empirical
findings linking Big Five measures to life outcomes have reinforced the
concurrent validity of the test scores interpretations. At the same
time, the broad nature of the domains has spurned research into the more
fine-grained lower order structure of facets.

\hypertarget{facet-structures}{%
\subsection{1.3. Facet Structures}\label{facet-structures}}

There are a number of models that include a facet structure below the
five broad domains. The most widely known model is the one suggested by
Costa and McCrae (1995), the NEO-PI-R model. Other popular models have
been suggested for the Big Five Inventory 2 (BFI-2; Soto \& John, 2016),
the IPIP (Goldberg et al., 2006), and the HEXACO model (Lee \& Ashton,
2016), which assumes six broad domains. \emph{Table 1} gives an overview
of these different models listing their facets per domain as well as
some information regarding their psychometric properties.

\vspace{5mm}

\textless{} Table 1 \textgreater{}

\vspace{5mm}

As shown in \emph{Table 1}, there are different possibilities of facets
forming the domains. However, there is still a degree of overlap between
the facets covered by the different instruments. Soto and John (2009)
inspected the convergences between the NEO-PI-R and the first version of
the BFI, suggesting that two constructs per domain were measured at the
facet level by both inventories. The constructs defined by Soto and John
(2009) were: \emph{Altruism} and \emph{Compliance} for Agreeableness;
\emph{Anxiety} and \emph{Depression} for Neuroticism; \emph{Order} and
\emph{Self-Discipline} for Conscientiousness; \emph{Assertiveness} and
\emph{Activity} for Extraversion; and \emph{Aesthetics} and \emph{Ideas}
for Openness. The convergence holds for the four instruments listed in
\emph{Table 1}, as these ten constructs are covered within the facets
for every instrument. Some of the constructs are explicitly covered at
the facet level (e.g.~Anxiety); meanwhile others are mainly covered by
the four instruments, although sometimes implicitly (e.g.~Liveliness in
HEXACO resembles the \enquote{core} construct Activity, present in all
other instruments). The reverse is not always true, not every facet
within the four instruments is covered by the constructs proposed by
Soto and John (2009). As an example we find Self-Consciousness, a
Neuroticism facet defined by the NEO-PI-R and the IPIP-NEO-120, which is
not intrinsically tapping at either Anxiety or Depression. The same
authors asserted in a later work (Soto \& John, 2016) that the Big Five
domains \emph{\enquote{can be conceptualized and assessed more broadly
or more narrowly}}, either focusing in a central facet or in a set of
peripheral facets, depending the research interest.

The mid-level layer between domains and facets has also been explored by
DeYoung, Quilty, and Peterson (2007). Their work has focused in the
biological consistency of the NEO-PI-R set of facets, thereby proposing
a two factor source of variance for each facet of the inventory. In line
with their proposal, Agreeableness would be composed by
\emph{Compassion} and \emph{Politeness}; Neuroticism by
\emph{Volatility} and \emph{Withdrawal}; Conscientiousness by
\emph{Industriousness} and \emph{Orderliness}; Extraversion by
\emph{Enthusiasm} and \emph{Assertiveness}; and Openness by
\emph{Intellect} and \emph{Openness}. Both Soto and John (2009) and
DeYoung et al. (2007) proposals have many points in common. Maybe the
labels \emph{Volatility} and \emph{Withdrawal} for Neuroticism can be
suspicious of a different content than \emph{Anxiety} and
\emph{Depression}, but when inspected at the item level it is revealed
that they are tapping the same components respectively (DeYoung et al.
(2007); for item specification).

The nomological network commonly assumed in Big Five questionnaires is
drawn from nuances through facets to domains, from more specific to more
general. Relying on domains to explain and predict behavior can benefit
from ease of interpretability. However, predictions for specific
contexts can be enhanced if a more specific set of traits is used. On
the other hand, using nuances to predict behavior might yield even
stronger predictive ability (Seeboth \& Mõttus, 2018), but as the number
of predictors grows the interpretations become more complex. Facets are
on a middle ground between nuances and domains, in a compromise between
specificity and sensitivity in the bandwidth-fidelity dilemma. This
narrow aggregation both satisfies the specificity of predictions to
concrete situations and environments and also enhances the ease of
interpretability when summarizing individual personality
characteristics.

Personality measured at the facet level has found to be a strong
predictor of a large number of outcomes. Satisfaction with life (SWL) is
one of them. Neuroticism and Extraversion were recognised as the most
important personality dimensions in the prediction of subjective
satisfaction ({\textbf{???}}; Diener, Oishi, \& Lucas, 2003). Lately,
({\textbf{???}}) observed that the analysis at the facet level
outperform the analysis at the domain level. They observed that
\emph{Depression} and \emph{Positive Emotions} / \emph{Cheerfulness}
explained SWL above and beyond the dimensions they belong to, reaching
to a 30\% of explained variability of SWL. Correlations in the
({\textbf{???}}) study ranged in a longitudinal design from \emph{r} =
-.57 to \emph{r} = -.49 for the first and from \emph{r} = .51 to
\emph{r} = .38 for the second and third. We hypothesize that the facets
\emph{Confidence} (N2) and \emph{Positive attitude} (E4) developed in
our instrument will behave similarly

Another relevant outcome that has shown to be best predicted with
personality at the facet level is academic achievement.
Conscientiousness and Openness to experience have been regarded as the
most important dimensions to predict academic success. The relation of
Conscientiousness with school grades has gained a stable empirical
evidence, widely inspected in the meta-analysis by O'Connor and Paunonen
(2007), were the mean correlation was \emph{r} = .24, our second
hypothesis will be to replicate this finding. O'Connor and Paunonen
(2007) found that \emph{Achievement-striving}, \emph{Self-discipline}
and \emph{Dutifulness} were the best predictors of academic performance
under the Conscientiousness domain (ranging from \emph{r} = .15 to
\emph{r} = .39, from \emph{r} = .18 to \emph{r} = .46, and from \emph{r}
= .25 to \emph{r} = .46 respectively), to replicate this finding will be
our third hypothesis. Openness is supposed to play an important role in
predicting academic achievement, however evidence has been elusive at
the dimension level (Ziegler et al., 2010a). Openness to ideas has been
found to be a facilitator towards better GPA, wih correlations being
found \emph{r} = .22 in Dollinger and Orf (1991) and \emph{r} = .15 in
Ziegler et al. (2010b). We expect to find similar correlations with
\emph{Open mindedness} (O3) in our fourth hypothesis. Often different
facets within the same domain can have effects in opposite directions,
partially canceling out the predictive ability of the dimensions. This
could be the case of Openness to experience, were facet-level analysis
can be unveiling. Openness to fantasy has found to yield a negative
relation to GPA \emph{r} = -.22 for men, whereas Aesthetics yielded a
similar relationship with GPA for women \emph{r} = -.19 (De Fruyt \&
Mervielde, 1996). In our case we expect that \emph{Creativity} (O1)
yield negative correlations with GPA for both sexes, and the overall
effect of Opennes on academic achievement being nearly zero, this will
be our fifth hypothesis.

Likewise, personality has proven to be a powerful predictor of laboral
and educational abseentism (Judge, Martocchio, \& Thoresen, 1997;
Salgado, 2002). Research has highlighted the predictive power of
personality over integrity test when predicting absences (Ones,
Viswesvaran, \& Schmidt, 2003). Again, most research has focused on the
dimensional level, although some researchers suggested that personality
assessed at a narrower level would improve the predictive ability of the
models (Lounsbury, Steel, Loveland, \& Gibson, 2004; Salgado, 2002).
Nonetheless, few studies have explored this relationship to our
knowledge, being Lounsbury et al. (2004) and Judge et al. (1997) the
most prominent. Judge et al. (1997) reported no predictive gain when
examining personality at the facet level for the NEO-PI-R composites of
Extraversion and Conscientiousness, whereas Lounsbury et al. (2004)
found a modest predictive gain of \emph{Work drive} over the Big Five
dimensions. Therefore, and despite the conceptual expectation of facets
maximizing the predictive ability of personality on abseentism, evidence
has manifested in favour of a dimension level analysis. Therefore our
sixth hypothesis of the criterion validity section will be that
\emph{Persistence} (C2) will add a significative proportion of variance
explained in the model which includes the five dimensions. Furthermore,
this study would help to envision the research question of which facets
could be involved in the relation between personality and school
abseentism.

As described above, facet measures often yield scores that have stronger
test-criterion correlations than their respective domain scores.
However, facet scores have also been shown to be related to personality
disorders. Thus, the combination of a higher fidelity along with the
potential clinical relevance of facet scores might open up unique
advantages for clinical research.

\hypertarget{the-big-five-and-personality-disorders}{%
\subsection{1.4. The Big Five and Personality
Disorders}\label{the-big-five-and-personality-disorders}}

Personality disorders are steadily shifting from a categorical
definition into a continua conceptualization within the clinical realm.
This process is not new for personality science history, as the subject
itself moved from a qualitatively distinct set of definitions, called
types, into a subset of continuous domains in which both normality and
extreme tendencies were moving along, named traits. In fact, the new
version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders,
DSM-V, now proposes two different ways of assessing personality
disorders: 1) A descriptive model of personality disorders in section II
which mimics the former model of assessing personality disorders and; 2)
A novel trait model that follows research on the personality scientific
domain (In section III), which conceptualizes personality disorders as
extreme tendencies located in the continuum of the Big Five domains and
facets (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Widiger \&
Mullins-Sweatt, 2009)

This paradigm shift in clinical assessment of personality has led to the
construction of the Personality Disorder Inventory (PID-5; Krueger,
Derringer, Markon, Watson, \& Skodol, 2012), a 25-facet and
five-dimension self-report inventory, with an informant-report version
(Markon, Quilty, Bagby, \& Krueger, 2013). These five dimensions mirror
the Big Five domains, although with a focus on the maladaptative end of
the continuum,: I) Detachment (Big Five's Introversion), II) Antagonism
(absence of Big Five's Agreeableness), III) Disinhibition (absence of
Big Five's Conscientiousness), IV) Negative affect (Big Five's
Neuroticism) and V) Psychoticism (Absence of Big Five's Openness). The
PID-5 has shown satisfying evidences of criterion validity
(\ldots{}summary). However, the number of facets per domain on the PID-5
is limited.

In line with what has been stated previously for academic achievement,
the examination of facets may result in an enhancement of the
specificity of assessment when looking at the nature of PDs (Clark,
2005; Samuel \& Widiger, 2008). This improvement of specificity resulted
in a predictive gain ranging from 3\% to 16\% when comparing facets to
domains predicting PD in a study by Reynolds and Clark (2001).
Furthermore, the use of facets may be of extreme utility for those PD
whose personality profile is less clear at the domain level. As Saulsman
and Page (2004) pointed out, Schizotypal and Obsessive-Compulsive
disorders are examples of PD which are not well covered by Big Five
domains. A reason for it may be found in a pattern inconsistency of
facets within the same dimension or in a lack of coverage for essential
characteristics of the PD. For example, aberrant cognitions are
essential characteristics of schizotypal disorder and are not covered by
some instrument's facets like the NEO-PI-R (Samuel \& Widiger, 2008;
Saulsman \& Page, 2004). Likewise, the expected high scores on warmth
and low scores on assertiveness could mask the effects of extraversion
when predicting Dependent Personality Disorder, following the
theoretical correspondence between PD and Big Five facets proposed by
Costa Jr. and Widiger (1994). Moreover, the PID-5 has prompted the
elaboration of a number of Five Factor Model Personality Disorders
(FFMPD) scales to maximize the facet coverage in relation to specific
PDs (Bagby \& Widiger, 2018).

Facet analysis and dedicated Big Five questionnaires have been used to
solve issues like those mentioned in the last paragraph. We propose to
base such research on a broader facet basis. To this end we suggest a
general instrument to cover a broad number of facets which could aim for
fine grained assessments.

\hypertarget{this-study}{%
\subsection{This study}\label{this-study}}

We present in this paper an instrument for personality assessment which
aims to cover the need for an internationally usable, open source, and
differentiated measure at the facet level. Two studies are presented,
for each one inspects the factor structure of the instrument in a
different sample drawn from a different culture (American vs.~German).
Measurement invariance across samples will be examined. Internal
consistency and test-criterion correlations will be estimated for all
scores. To sum up, the aim for this research project was to provide an
instrument that can be used in non-clinical but also in clinical
research which emphasizes the facet level of the Big Five.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

Two different studies are presented in this work. The first study uses a
sample drawn from the USA bachelor student population. The aim was to
detect and confirm a model that maximizes the facet space below the Big
Five domains. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to identify the
number of facets per domain. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) per
facet was specified in order to confirm the item - facet relationship.
Finally, an exploratory strucutural equation model (ESEM) was applied to
test a full model in which the facets serve as indicators of the Big
Five domains. ESEM has gained reputation in the personality field, where
the independent cluster model may not capture the complexity of the
constructs measured (Marsh et al., 2010).

The second sample is a sample representative for the German speaking
population of Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The aim for the second
study was to replicate the structure found in study one, plus assess the
degree of measurement invariance of the proposed model.

The sample consisted of 722 American undergraduate students (59.30\%

5.90). Students were emailed a link to a computerized assessment battery
that included the IPIP items as well as several other tests not reported
in this paper. The data set was randomly split into two equally sized
samples. Both samples were matched in relation to missing values,
outliers and extreme values. In Sample 1 the mean age was 21.80 years
(SD= 6.30), in Sample 2 the mean age was 21.50 years (SD=5.60).

Altogether, 525 items from the \emph{International Personality Item
Pool} (IPIP) were used to measure Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness
(to experience), Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. The IPIP is an
open source database of personality items, which was launched in 1996,
and contains over 2000 items (Goldberg et al., 2006). Participants were
asked to rate themselves on typical behaviors or reactions on a 5-point
Likert scale, ranging from 1 (\enquote{Not all like me}) to 5
(\enquote{Very much like me}).

The item selection was part of a different project and the procedure has
been explained in detail in the appendix of a study by MacCann,
Duckworth, and Roberts (2009). That study also contains part of the
sample used here. However, the current data set contains more
participants.

To determine the number of possible facets per domain Velicer (1976)
Minimum Average Partial (MAP) method and Horn (1965) parallel analysis
(PA) were employed for every domain. Based on these results an
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was calculated for each domain via
Mplus using a geomin rotation (Quelle) and a Maximum Likelihood
estimator (ML). The decision for the preferred number of facets per
domain was based partly on comparing model fits (CFI, RMSEA, SRMR). More
importantly though was the interpretability of the facet solution. To
this end, facet solutions from other personality measures were looked
and compared to the found facet structure. If there were important parts
missing to present the domain with regards to content, new facets were
added a posteriori.

\hypertarget{cfa-and-esem-with-subsample-1}{%
\subsubsection{CFA and ESEM with subsample
1}\label{cfa-and-esem-with-subsample-1}}

To confirm the structure of facets the EFAs delivered, multiple CFAs
were calculated via Mplus. In a first step, measurement models were
estimated for each of the facets. To obtain balance between the facets,
the items were reduced to five per facet based on item content and
loading pattern. In a second step, the estimations for the measurement
models on facet levels were repeated via CFA. For both steps estimators
were WLSMV (Weighted Least Squares adjusted for Means and Variances).
Aim was to ensure an optimal breadth and sufficient reliability. In a
final model, all five domain structural models were integrated using
ESEM (Asparouhov \& Muthén, 2009). Marsh et al. (2010) could show that
ESEM fits personality data better and results in substantially more
differentiated factors than CFA. All facets were allowed to load on all
domains. If there would show up facets that do not significantly load on
the intended domain, this facets would get eliminated subsequently. The
estimators used were ML !WLSMV?, factor scores from the facet CFAs were
used as indicators and the rotation was oblique (using Geomin). Model
fit was determined based on the guide lines by Hu and Bentler (1999) as
well as Beauducel and Wittmann (2005). Consequently, to consider a good
fit of a proposed model, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) should be at or
over .95, the Standardized Root Mean Squared Residual (SRMR) smaller
than .08 and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) smaller
than .06. For the ESEM models we compared our results with the findings
by Marsh et al. (2010).

Chronbach's \(\alpha\) and McDonald's \(\omega\) will be calculated for

\hypertarget{criterion-validity-evidence}{%
\subsubsection{Criterion validity
evidence}\label{criterion-validity-evidence}}

To examine the nomological structure of the facets and domains to
external constructs, a set of linear models and correlations were
fitted. We describe here a set of hypothesis prompted by other's
research in the interplay between personality and the external criteria
which we had access for this work.

To explore the first hypothesis which predicts SWL (N2 would correlate
from a range \emph{r} = -.57 and \emph{r} = -.49; and E4 would correlate
\emph{r} = .51 to \emph{r} = .38) we fitted a linear model that included
N2 and E4 as predictors. Furthermore we fitted a stepwise regression
with all the facets to find covered relations. In a third model we
compared the power of E4 and N2 with their respective domains,
Extraversion and Neuroticism.

The second to sixth hypothesis involves academic achievement as
criterion variable. The second and third hypothesis will be explored via
inspection of the correlation matrix with the Big Five dimensions. The
fourth hypothesis will be explored by means of a stepwise regression
were all the Conscientiousness facets will form the initial set of
predictors. The fifth hypothesis will be explored with a simple
regression of O3 on high school grades. The sixth hypothesis will be
explored by inspecting the correlation of the facets forming Openness
with academic achievement.

The seventh hypothesis involves the relations between educational
abseentism and personality. To explore whether C2 would add predictive
power to the five dimensions on predictive absences, we will fit a two
step regression. Finally, a stepwise regression of all facets on school
absentism will be fitted to explore predictions at the facet level.

In \emph{Table 2} model fits for the chosen facet model for each domain
are shown, as well as Eigenvalues and results from MAP and PA test. To
ensure the homogeneity of the facets and to reduce the risk of cross
domain loadings, items with factor loadings less than .30 were
eliminated. This was only done when item content was also judged as
being non-central to the domain in question (Ziegler et al., 2014).

\vspace{5mm}

\textless{} Table 2 here\textgreater{}

\vspace{5mm}

According to the exploratory model, Agreeableness consists of eight
facets after two facets were eliminated due to weakly loading and
inconsistent items. The remaining facets were named Appreciation,
Integrity, Low Competitiveness, Readiness to Give Feedback, Search for
Support, Good Faith, Genuineness and Altruism.

Conscientiousness consists of nine facets after one facet with item
factor loadings less than .30 was excluded, they are: Dominance,
Persistence, Self-discipline, Task planning, Goal orientation,
Carefulness, Orderliness, Wish to work to capacity and Productivity.

Extraversion is formed by nine facets. A new facet (Energy) was added in
order to tap better the physical component of Extraversion, which was
missing in the eight facet solution. The facets are Sociability,
Readiness to take risks, Wish for affiliation, Positive attitude,
Forcefulness, Communicativeness, Humor, Conviviality and Energy.

Neuroticism (interpreted here as emotional stability) consists of seven
facets. One facet was dropped due to poor interpretability, and was
therefore not included in the subsequent analyses. The final set of
facets are named Equanimity, Confidence, Carefreeness, Mental balance,
Drive, Emotional robustness and Self-attention.

Openness to experience comprises nine facets. One facet was identified
as a method factor and eliminated, because it solely contained
negatively formulated items and no coherent underlying trait could be
identified. Furthermore another facet (Intellect) was added, because the
remaining facets lacked an intellectual content. The facets of Openness
are named Creativity, Wish for variety, Open-mindedness, Interest in
reading, Artistic interests, Wish to analyze, Willingness to learn,
Sensitivity and Intellect.

The items to each facet are listed in the appendix (A).

\hypertarget{results-of-cfa-and-esem}{%

All measurement models for the facets fitted well, results are
summarized in \emph{Table 3}. In this table both models with five items
only and models with all items are presented with their respective model
fit. The 5-item facets normally outperform the models including all
items regarding model fit.

The ESEM of the final model with all five domains yielded an acceptable
fit (Marsh et al., 2010): CFI = .87, RMSEA = .072, SRMR = .036. As it
can be seen in \emph{Table 4} nearly all facets loaded significantly on
their intended domain. Some cross loadings emerged as is typical for
ESEM procedures.

Reliabilities for the 5 item facets were calculated with \(\alpha\) and

and a mean \(\omega\) of 0.69. Conscientiousness' mean \(\alpha\) =
0.68, and mean \(\omega\) = 0.70. Openness' mean \(\alpha\) = 0.76, and
mean \(\omega\) = 0.77. Neuroticism mean \(\alpha\) = 0.68, and mean
\(\omega\) = 0.69. TExtraversion's mean \(\alpha\) = 0.72, and mean
\(\omega\) = 0.74.

\hypertarget{criterion-validity-evidence-1}{%
\subsubsection{Criterion validity
evidence}\label{criterion-validity-evidence-1}}

Our first hypothesis concerning external criteria involved
\emph{Confidence} (N2) and \emph{Positive attitude} (E4), as the most
important predictors of SWL. Our results, in line with Schimmack, Oishi,
Furr, and Funder (2004), showed that both facets were the most salient
predictors of the factor in a stepwise regresssion, and that they
explained 0.34\% of the factor. The final model reached with the
stepwise procedure explained 0.41\% of the factor variance. N2 and E4
outperformed Neuroticism and Extraversion, who failed to be significant
predictors in a stepwise model which included these four independent
variables.

Our second hypothesis was set to replicate the findings of the
meta-analysis by O'Connor and Paunonen (2007) with our instrument. In
the mentioned study Conscientiousness showed the higher correlations
with school grades with a corrected \(\rho\) = .24, and the facets
\emph{Achievement striving}, \emph{Self-discipline} and
\emph{Dutifulnes} were the most important predictors at a narrower
level. Our results are in line with those reported by O'Connor and
Paunonen (2007). Conscientiousness correlated \emph{r} = 0.23 with high
school grades. At the facet level, C2 correlated \emph{r} = 0.12, C3
\emph{r} = 0.13 and C6 \emph{r} = 0.16 with high school grades. On the
other hand, Openness \emph{r} = 0.15 and Agreebleness \emph{r} = 0.20 at
the dimension level; and \emph{Goal orientation} (C5) \emph{r} = 0.22 at
the facet level also showed high correlations with grades, a result not
found in O'Connor and Paunonen (2007).

The fourth hypothesis involves \emph{Open mindedness} (O3) as an
Opennesss facilitator towards achieving higher grades. We have found a
correlation of \emph{r} = 0.14 between this facet and high school
grades, in line with the findings of Ziegler et al. (2010b).
Furthermore, we expected some inverse correlations between the facets of
Openness, and as a result a near zero correlation with the dimension. We
haven't found any Openness facet with a significant inverse correlation
with high school grades, and as indicated previously our results don't
support a zero correlation of the dimension with high school grades.

Another relevant outcome that has shown to be best predicted with
personality at the facet level is academic achievement. The relation of
Conscientiousness with school grades has gained a stable empirical
evidence, widely inspected in the meta-analysis by O'Connor and Paunonen
(2007) were the mean \(\rho\) was .24. At the facet level, O'Connor and
Paunonen (2007) found that \emph{Achievement-striving},
\emph{Self-discipline} and \emph{Dutifulness} were the best predictors
of academic performance, ranging from \emph{r} = .15 to \emph{r} = .39,
from \emph{r} = .18 to \emph{r} = .46, and from \emph{r} = .25 to
\emph{r} = .46 respectively. In the inventory presented here, the facets
\emph{Persistence} (C2), \emph{Self-discipline} (C3) and
\emph{Carefulnes} (C6) are the most related with the previous. Our
second hypothesis would be to replicate this findings. Openness is also
supposed to play an important role in predicting academic achievement,
however evidence has been elusive at the dimension level (Ziegler et
al., 2010a). Openness to ideas has been found to be a facilitator
towards better GPA, wih correlations being found \emph{r} = .22 in
Dollinger and Orf (1991) and \emph{r} = .15 in Ziegler et al. (2010b).
We expect to find similar correlations with \emph{Open mindedness} (O3)
in our third hypothesis. Often different facets within the same domain
can have effects in opposite directions, partially canceling out the
predictive ability of the dimensions. This could be the case of Openness
to experience, were facet-level analysis can be unveiling. Openness to
fantasy has found to yield a negative relation to GPA \emph{r} = -.22
for men, whereas Aesthetics yielded a similar relationship with GPA for
women \emph{r} = -.19 (De Fruyt \& Mervielde, 1996). In our case we
expect that \emph{Creativity} (O1) yield negative correlations with GPA
for both sexes, and the overall effect of Opennes on academic
achievement being nearly zero, this will be our fourth hypothesis.

The second to sixth hypothesis involves academic performance as
criterion variable. The second and third hypothesis will be explored via
inspection of the correlation matrix with the Big Five dimensions. The
fourth hypothesis will be explored by means of a stepwise regression
were all the Conscientiousness facets will form the initial set of
predictors. The fifth hypothesis will be explored with a simple
regression of O3 on high school grades. The sixth hypothesis will be
explored by inspecting the correlation of the facets forming Openness
with academic achievement.

Bivariate correlations of the facets with the external criteria are
shown in \emph{Table 5}. The facets N2 (Confidence, r = 0.53) and E4
(Positive attitude, r = 0.49) show the highest correlations with life
satisfaction respectively. The SWL scale was also correlated with facets
such as N4 (Mental balance, r = 0.25) and N5 (Drive, r = 0.27) in the
Neuroticism / Emotional stability realm. C5 (Goal orientation, r = 0.28)
and C2 (Persistence, r = 0.27) in Conscientiousness. E1 (Sociability, r
= 0.26) and E9 (Energy, r = 0.25) in the Extraversion domain. O9
(Intellect, r = 0.24) and O3 (Open-mindedness, r = 0.22) in Openness and
A6 (Good faith, r = 0.25) in the Agreeableness domain.

Regarding the academic performance criteria (GPA, SAT and ACT), the
Openness facets O4 (Interest in reading), O6 (Wish to analyze) and O9
(Intellect) yield the most consistent correlations. Interestingly, O4
correlates directly with the reading subtests of SAT (r = 0.25) and ACT
(r = 0.2) and shows a negligible relationship with the math (r = 0.06 /
0.08) subscales.

Furthermore, the global GPA scale (assuming cc is for global) correlated
with several Conscientiousness and Agreeableness facets. C9
(Productivity, r = 0.4), C5 (Goal orientation, r = 0.38) and C4 (Task
planning, r = 0.35) yield the higher correlations with overall GPA
respectively in the Conscientiousness domain, and A1 (Appreciation, r =
0.32) in the Agreeableness domain.

Concerning the behavioral criteria controlled in this study, absence
from class, the meaningful correlations unsurprisingly loaded within the
facets at the Conscientiousness domain. Particularly the facets C4 (Task
planning, r = -0.22 / -0.26), C7 (C6: Carefulness, r = -0.21 / -0.21)
and C9 (Productivity, r = -0.21 / -0.24) were the most robust indicators
of this criteria.

To check the facet structure Study 1 delivered, multiple confirmatory
factor analyses were calculated via Mplus following an analogue
procedure to Study 1. First, measurement models were estimated for all
facets, using WLSMV as the estimator. Model fit was determined based on
the guide lines mentioned above. In a final model, all five domain
structural models were integrated using ESEM.

\hypertarget{step-2-testing-for-measurement-invariance.}{%
\subsubsection{Step 2 -- Testing for measurement
invariance.}\label{step-2-testing-for-measurement-invariance.}}

In a next step, measurement invariance between German and US samples was
examined. We followed the procedure suggested by Sass (2011) and tested
configural, factorial and strong factorial invariance. The cutoffs
suggested by Chen (2007) were applied to compare model fits. According
to this configural measurement invariance can be assumed when the same
item is associated with the same factor in each domain, while the factor
loadings can differ. If the factor loadings of each item would not
differ between the samples, factorial measurement invariance can be
assumed. Strong factorial measurement invariance can be assumed when on
top of that the intercepts of each item are equal. The limit to
factorial measurement invariance was set to \(\Delta\) CFI \textless{}
.01, \(\Delta\) RMSEA \textless{} .015 and \(\Delta\) SRMR \textless{}
.03, at which the limit to strong factorial measurement invariance was
set to \(\Delta\) CFI \textless{} .01, \(\Delta\) RMSEA \textless{}

For analyzing measurement invariance the latest facet model structure

Configural measurement invariance could be shown for the facets
Appreciation of others, Superiority/Grandiosity, Need to be liked,
Crybabiness, Manipulation, Altruism (facets of Agreeableness),
Perseverance, Task Planning, Goal-orientation/Achievement striving,
Preferred Load, Procrastination (facets of Conscientiousness),
Assertiveness, Sociability/Gregariousness, Activity (facets of
Extraversion), Irritability, Self-serving Attention (facets of
Neuroticism), Self-attributed Inginuity, Openness to actions and
activities, Openmindedness/Judgement, Love of Learning, Openness to
feelings and Intellect (facets of Openness).

Factorial measurement invariance could be shown for the facets Meanness,
Trust (facets of Agreeableness), Control of others, Lack of (Self-)
Control, Deliberation/Caution, Lack of Tidiness/Order (facets of
Conscientiousness), Sensation Seeking, Reclusiveness, Emotionality,
Humor (facets of Extraversion), Depression, Anxiety, Self-assuredness,
Lethargia, Sentimentality (facets of Neuroticism), Openness to reading,
Openness to arts and Need for cognition (facets of Openness).

The only facet with strong factorial measurement invariance was Shyness,
a facet of Extraversion

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

We have presented in this work an open-access instrument for personality
assessment within the Big Five framework, which showed evidences of
factorial validity in two different cultures and maximized the space set
of facets encompassed. With a modest number of items (202) by comparison
with the most influential Big Five inventories presented in \emph{Table
1}, we have reached to a large set of facets which mostly show a robust
factorial validity in both studies, as shown in \emph{Table 3}.

The Big Five solution has been recognized as the most replicable model
for personality inventories, reaching a hallmark of consensus in
personality science for the last decades. However, some researchers have
pointed out that while the Big Five has repeatedely been found when
fitting EFA to personality data, its replicability under CFA procedures
has been more elusive (McCrae, Zonderman, Costa, Bond, \& Paunonen,
1996). The constriction of the common independent cluster solution,
where cross-loadings are restricted to zero, may suppose a rather strong
assumption for personality trait inventories (Marsh et al., 2010). The
idea of facets, or habits, being influenced by more than one domain can
definitely make some sense. ESEM helps overcoming this assumption and
provides a measure about how well the Big Five solution adjusts to the
data. Using this procedure, the degree of integration of our proposed
set of facets to the Big Five factor solution has been solid enough
according to the cut-off values proposed by Marsh et al. (2010). The
number of significant cross-loadings in the ESEM models has not been
large either, advocating a good discriminant validity.

The instrument presented in this work covers all the \enquote{core}
facets proposed by Soto and John (2009), either directly or indirectly.
The \emph{Energy} construct in Extraversion is literally covered by a
three-item facet in our instrument, whereas the \emph{Assertiveness}
construct has been tapped by items belonging to the \emph{Wish for
affiliation}, \emph{Communicativeness} and \emph{Conviviality} facets.
\emph{Altruism} is directly reflected in a five-item facet, while the
\emph{Compliance} construct is reflected by our \emph{Good faith} facet.
The \emph{Order} and \emph{Self-discipline} constructs proposed by Soto
and John (2009) are mirrored by dedicated facets in our instrument. The
\emph{Anxiety} and \emph{Depression} constructs are mirrored by the
facets \emph{Mental balance} and \emph{Emotional robustness},
respectively. For the \emph{Openess} dimension, the \emph{Aesthetic}
contruct is covered by our facet \emph{Artistic interest}, while the
\emph{Ideas} construct has been reflected by both the
\emph{Open-mindedness} and the \emph{Wish to analyze} facets. The
two-per-facet components proposed by DeYoung et al. (2007) were also
being tapped by the set of facets in our inventory.

The instrument covers most of facets proposed by the most influential
Big Five measures as seen in \emph{Table 1}. The most salient
differences are related to the HEXACO model, which entails a six factor
solution with a slightly different theoretical conceptualization (Lee \&
Ashton, 2006). Most notably

Although these facets are not being covered directly in our inventory,
components of facets from distinct domains in our model retain a glimpse
of the missing facets. This underlies the importance of allowing
cross-loadings for trait personality data. Let's use the example of
\emph{Patience}, a facet proposed in the HEXACO model for the
Agreeableness domain which is not covered in our instrument, nor in the
other three Big Five inventories which have been revised. Although
patience, there is a notion of a patient trait within the
Self-discipline facet in the Conscientiousness domain, specially with
items such as \enquote{I rush into things} or \enquote{I act impulsively
when something is bothering me} (See appendix A). In fact,
Self-discipline has important cross-loadings with Agreeableness in both
samples (\(\lambda\) = .256 in the USA sample and \(\lambda\) = .341 in
the german sample).

In addition we included even more facets.

In addition, evidences for external criteria validity were attained.

We have collected some criterion validity evidences. Like bla bla bla.
Nonetheless the multi - facetted nature of the instrument makes
forthcoming evidences for criterion and predictive validity promising.

One limitation is the sample used. Students are not a representative
population of society and results may not be generalized.

Future directions are to provide a tool with the subset of items for
public use. Gather community sample, from more cultures and test the
extent of the universality of the instrument. And use the instrument to
predict important life outcomes so the links between specific behaviors
and facets become richer.
